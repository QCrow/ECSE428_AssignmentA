Feature: Non-functional requirements for data management

Scenario: Verify data management efficiency
Given a system with a user base of 10,000 users
When the system is managing user data
Then the system shall efficiently manage and store user data with a response time of less than 1 second
And the system shall have robust data management and backup procedures in place, with a backup frequency of at least once a day

Scenario: Verify scalability of data storage
Given a system with a user base of 10,000 users
When the user base grows to 100,000 users
Then the system shall be able to handle large amounts of data, with the ability to scale to accommodate the growth in user data

Scenario: Verify data retrieval efficiency
Given a system with a user base of 10,000 users
When a user performs a search for data
Then the system shall be able to efficiently search and retrieve data, with a response time of less than 1 second for data retrieval
And the system shall have fast and accurate search functionality, with a maximum error rate of 5%.
