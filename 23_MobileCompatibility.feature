Feature: Responsive Design
  As a user, I expect the system to be fully responsive, with a mobile-friendly user interface that is optimized for smaller screens and touch-based navigation.

Scenario: Verify Responsiveness
  Given the user accesses the system's user interface on a mobile device
  When the user navigates the interface and performs actions
  Then the user interface should be optimized for smaller screens and touch-based navigation, with all elements and buttons easily accessible and usable.

Scenario: Verify Compatibility
  Given the user accesses the system on a mobile device
  When the user checks the system's compatibility with their device
  Then the system should be compatible with the user's mobile device and display correctly on the device's screen.

Scenario: Verify Feature Availability
  Given the user accesses the system on a mobile device
  When the user checks the availability of features and functionality on their device
  Then all features and functionality should be available on the mobile device, providing a seamless experience for the user.
