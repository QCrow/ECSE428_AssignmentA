Feature: Fast and Responsive User Interface
  As a user, I expect the system to have a fast and responsive user interface, with minimal loading times and lag.

Scenario: Verify Loading Times
  Given the user accesses the system's user interface
  When the user navigates between pages and performs actions
  Then the page loading times should be less than 2 seconds, and there should be minimal lag.

Scenario: Verify Scalability
  Given the number of users and traffic to the system increases
  When the user checks the system's performance
  Then the system's performance should not degrade significantly, and should be able to handle the increased traffic and user numbers.

Scenario: Verify Performance Optimization
  Given the user accesses the system's user interface
  When the user checks the system's performance optimization techniques
  Then the system should be using techniques such as caching and minification to reduce load times and improve the user experience, resulting in a page loading time of less than 1 second.
