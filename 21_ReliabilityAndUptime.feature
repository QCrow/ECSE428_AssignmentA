Feature: System Availability
  As a user, I expect the system to have an availability rate of 99.5% or higher, with no single point of failure that would cause a system-wide outage.

Scenario: Verify System Availability
  Given the system is in use
  When the user checks the system's availability rate
  Then the system's availability rate should be 99.5% or higher, with no single point of failure that would cause a system-wide outage.

Scenario: Verify Disaster Recovery and Backup Procedures
  Given an unexpected event occurs that causes system downtime
  When the user checks the system's disaster recovery and backup procedures
  Then the system's disaster recovery and backup procedures should be robust and minimize downtime.

Scenario: Verify Unexpected Event Handling
  Given an unexpected event or error occurs, such as a server crash or power outage
  When the user continues to use the system
  Then the system should handle the unexpected event or error without impacting the user experience.
